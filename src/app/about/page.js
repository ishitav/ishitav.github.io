              Hello there!
            </h1>

            I'm Ishita Vasishtha, a junior at the University of Southern California studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. My work focuses primarily on hardware design, machine learning and wireless systems. I've had the amazing oppurtunity to be a part of the Wireless Systems and Devices Group and the Autonomous Research Netowork Group during my time here. My research focuses primarily on machine learning and wireless systems. I'm particularly interested in hardware design, edge computing and how hardware can be used for biotech applications! Outside of engineering, I enjoy chess puzzles, jewelry making, and exploring new LA cafes.
